# **Speech-Based Dementia Detection Using Whisper and Log Neural Controlled Differential Equations**
This repository contains the implementation of a speech-based dementia detection model combining Whisper and LogNCDEs.
## **Dateset**
Our experiments were conducted using three publicly available datasets: ADReSS, ADReSSo, and DementiaBank, each containing speech samples from healthy controls (HC) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients.In the DementiaBank dataset specifically, some participants exhibited changes in diagnostic categories during follow-up (mainly MCI converting to AD), so all MCI cases were excluded from this study to maintain a clean binary classification. The table below shows the speech sample counts from each dataset:
